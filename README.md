# ml-task4-logistic-regression
Overview
This project builds a binary classifier using Logistic Regression.
The dataset is preprocessed, split into train/test sets, standardized, and evaluated with common classification metrics.

 Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
 Steps Performed
Loaded a binary classification dataset (e.g., Breast Cancer dataset).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Standardized features using StandardScaler.
Trained a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluated performance using:
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
ROC Curve and ROC-AUC
Tuned decision threshold and explained sigmoid function behavior.
Results:-

The model provides probabilities for each class and demonstrates how adjusting the threshold affects precision and recall.
ROC–AUC score shows overall model performance.
How to Run

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Run the script or notebook to train the model and view all evaluation outputs.
